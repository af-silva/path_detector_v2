## Acknowledgements

Without any order of importance, I hereby acknowledge the great work done by all the developers
Involved in the implementation of each one of the packages that I used in my thesis and my thank you
for sharing the code that enables me to implement a new aplication. Without the work made by this 
developers I would be in grave trouble.

### Work in progress
Part of my work needs some additional features added to the LSD-SLAM code, all the modifications are
hereby commited and available to all, but the core of the algorithm has not in any way changed.
And the code is being changed, so do not expect a working project for final application. 
I'm updating every time I can, since i'm not doing this full time.
Also my thesis as a specific purpose and a data set will be available when it's finish.
